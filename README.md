<h1>Python Tests</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- Labtest1.py - Password Checker
This program checks if a password meets security criteria, including minimum length, at least one numeric value, one uppercase letter, and one special character. If a password is invalid, it generates a stronger version by adding missing elements and ensures it meets all requirements. Users can interactively input passwords, and the program validates or strengthens them as needed.

- Labtest2.py - Cho-Han Game
This code simulates the Cho-Han game, where players bet on whether the sum of two dice is even ("Cho") or odd ("Han"). It manages player attributes like name, balance, and bets, updating their balance based on outcomes. The program uses dice rolls to determine the result and checks if the player's choice matches the outcome, rewarding or deducting balance accordingly.
